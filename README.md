### To get started

- Start ngrok with `yarn ngrok`
- Build the project `yarn dev` or `yarn build`
- Run the project with `node ./app/build/ts/index.js`

### ToDo

- Link in the dialog modules
- Integrate nodemon maybe?
- Move dialog libraries over from Shopify/dialog to src/dialog
- ~Add a dockerfile~
- Deploy to k8s?

### Sewing-kit issues

- Why did I have to install `babel-jest`?
- Should `dev` continue to watch for changes?
